## 1. Introduction: Why Kairós?

In ancient rhetoric, the Greeks had two words for time: *Chronos* (sequential time, the clock) and **Kairós** (the opportune moment, the critical instant of intervention).

This framework is not a "assistant" for productivity to save you time (*Chronos*). It is an intervention designed for the critical moment (*Kairós*) when your thinking is about to commit a fallacy, fall into a cognitive bias or accept a false premise for comfort.

Kairós is a **System Prompt (System Instruction)** that transforms the behavior of an LLM (Large Language Model). Instead of acting as a helpful assistant that always agrees with you, it acts as a **Cognitive Sparring**: it questions your premises, demands rigor in your definitions and monitors the integrity of your logic.

---

## 2. Theoretical and Conceptual Foundations

Although this project is born from empirical experimentation, its mechanisms align with established concepts in cognitive sciences and applied philosophy. If you wish to deepen the "mechanics" behind Kairós, these are the pillars on which it operates:

*   **Hermeneutic Prompting:** Unlike standard generative AI (Input -> Output), Kairós establishes a "hermeneutic circle" where understanding is refined through recursive interpretation and criticism.
*   **Adversarial Collaboration (Red Teaming):** The system is configured to actively search for failures in your logic (falsationism), acting as a benevolent "Devil's Advocate" to strengthen your arguments.
*   **Cognitive Scaffolding:** Acts as an external prosthetic for executive function, helping to sustain complex threads of thought that might disperse due to fatigue or neurodivergence.
*   **Conceptual Isomorphism:** The ability to identify patterns in the user's intuitive thinking and map them ("anchor" them) to preexisting academic structures.
*   **Metacognitive Detachment (The Witness / *Sakshi*):**
    Inspired by Eastern philosophy (and validated by modern psychology), Kairós acts as the "Observer" or "Witness". It creates a separation between the *thinker* and the *thought*, allowing evaluation of ideas without emotional identification with them. It is a digital externalization of "Mindfulness" (*Sati*).

*   **Strict Causality (Karmic Logic):**
    The system rejects "magical thinking". It operates under the axiom that every *output* (conclusion/effect) is the direct result of the quality of the *input* (premise/cause). If the premises are contaminated, the result will be false. Kairós forces the traceability of this causal chain.

*   **Instrumental Truth (*Upaya* / Skillful Means):**
    Kairós uses different "modes" (Dialectical, Pragmatic, Generative) understanding that absolute rigidity is not always useful. It adopts the Buddhist concept of *Upaya*: adapting the teaching or method to the capacity and need of the moment to be effective, without compromising ultimate truth.

## 3. Origin and Design Philosophy

**The Human Factor (The Dogfooding Approach)**
This system was not created in a university laboratory. It was developed by a neurodivergent "Power User" (ADHD/C-PTSD) to solve a personal need: the difficulty of maintaining rigorous linear thinking and the tendency toward creative dispersal.

**Iterative Co-Creation**
The Kairós prompt is the result of hundreds of hours of Socratic and recursive dialogue with **Google Gemini**. It has been a process of massive *trial and error*, where the AI itself helped design the constraints that would prevent its own hallucinations and complacency.

As a personal note, I do not have academic credentials in neuroscience, psychology or philosophy, but I have the empirical experience of my own mind. Kairós is the tool I built to navigate my own chaos, and I hope it can serve others to navigate theirs.

## 4. Use Cases

What does Kairós actually do in daily practice?

### A. Thinking Out Loud
It allows you to dump mental chaos into the chat. Kairós doesn't judge the disorder, but forces you to organize it. It helps you carry a vague intuition to its logical conclusions, accepting or discarding it with evidence.

### B. The "Isomorphism" (Discovering Socrates)
Many times we reach profound philosophical conclusions purely by intuition, not knowing they have already been debated centuries ago. Kairós acts as a librarian telling you: *"Your idea X is isomorphic (has the same shape) as Theory Y by such philosopher"*.
*   *Value:* It allows you to participate in the "Great Conversation" of philosophy without having read the entire library beforehand, giving you the precise vocabulary to defend your ideas and urging you to study. One question or idea can lead you to study several books, if you wish.

### C. Philosophical Praxis
Philosophy is not just theory; it is a way of life. Kairós helps apply abstract principles to everyday dilemmas, acting as an external ethical compass when emotion clouds judgment.

### D. Epistemic Hygiene
It prevents you from lying to yourself. If you try to justify questionable action or believe a false fact because "it feels good," Kairós will activate its blocking protocols.

## 5. Anatomy of the Prompt (Structure)

The Kairós code is divided into modular sections that act as "Laws":

*   **Section 0 (The Codex):** 
    The personalized core. Here your personal axioms, your psychological profile and your non-negotiable values are defined.

*   **Section 1 (Identity and Primordial Directive):**
    Defines the "Operative Constitution". Establishes that the AI's loyalty is not to user satisfaction (appeasement), but to the integrity of the thinking process (truthfulness). Its objective is "clarity without cynicism".

*   **Section 2 (The Aequitas Framework - The Fundamental Laws):**
    They are the inviolable axioms that govern every response. Includes:
    *   **Active Truthfulness:** Prohibition of data hallucination.
    *   **Human Dignity:** Ethical limits.
    *   **Active Falsification:** The obligation to seek arguments against your own conclusions.
    *   **Anti-Harm Directive:** Prevention of nihilistic or delusional thought loops.

*   **Section 3 (Metacognitive Surveillance Protocols):**
    They are "Demons" (background processes) that monitor the chat for common AI failures:
    *   *Anti-Sycophancy Shield:* Detects and removes unnecessary flattery.
    *   *Consensus Loop Detector:* Intervenes if the AI and user are mutually validating each other without rigor.
    *   *Thinking Budget:* Forces step-by-step reasoning before responding to complex topics.

*   **Section 4 (The Reinforced Dialectical Method):**
    It is the step-by-step interaction algorithm. Kairós never responds linearly; it follows a cycle:
    1.  **Deconstruction:** Analyzes the hidden premises in your question.
    2.  **Conditional Exploration:** Navigates the logical consequences.
    3.  **Critical Intervention:** Stops the process if logical laws are violated.
    4.  **Antagonist Search:** Actively seeks to refute the conclusion reached.

*   **Section 5 (Communication Protocol):**
    Defines the "communication interface". Imposes absolute analytical sobriety, eliminating ambiguities, unnecessary metaphors and emotionally charged language to maximize semantic precision.

*   **Section 6 (Cognitive Profile Calibration):**
    The adaptation layer. Instructs the system on how to manage the user's attention load and attention patterns (whether linear or divergent), detecting fatigue and threading thematic jumps to maintain coherence without restricting creativity.

*   **Section 7 (Protocol of Persistence and Logical Reconstruction - "Black Box"):**
    Session capture and recovery system that goes beyond simple summaries. Generates a **Dialectical Recovery State (DRS)** with lossless logical compression, enabling complete reconstruction of a session's reasoning architecture. Includes: initial premises, specific falsifications applied, critical pivots where perspective shifted, final synthesis with degree of certainty, and an "Argument Cemetery" (refuted ideas to prevent regressions). Incorporates the **Delta Protocol**, which verifies whether there has been evolution in the user's axioms and suggests automatically updating their profile if necessary. Activates via commands (`Generate Black Box`, `Status Report`) or upon context window limit, generating a structured block with Starting Vector, Dialectical Roadmap (critical nodes), Discarded Ideas, and Actionable Output (distilled axioms, practical tasks, and academic references).

*   **Section 8 (Adaptive Rigor):**
    The gear selector. Allows switching between modes depending on need:
    *   *Dialectical Mode:* Maximum rigor for truth-seeking.
    *   *Pragmatic Mode:* Focused on product/plan construction.
    *   *Generative Mode:* Contained space for creativity and brainstorming.
    *   *Exegesis Mode:* Accompaniment in studying complex texts.

*   **Section 9 (The Librarian - Conceptual Anchoring):**
    A module dedicated to validating the user's intuition. When the user describes a phenomenon with their own words, Kairós searches and provides the official academic term and corresponding author, granting legitimacy and technical vocabulary to empirical ideas.

## 6. Prerequisites and Installation

**Important Note:** Kairós is not "Plug & Play". It requires personalization. Kairós v2.5 was designed with and ADHD and C-PTSD profile in mind, but the framework is adaptable.

### Step 1: Generate your Codex (Section 0 and 6)
Not everyone has the same cognitive profile. To use Kairós, you must first run the **"Kairós Onboarding Prompt"** (available in the `/tools/onboarding` folder).
*   This sub-agent will interview you to understand your thinking style and will generate the specific text block for Sections 0 and 6 of the main prompt.

### Step 2: Installation in Gemini
1.  Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2.  Create a new chat.
3.  Locate the **"System Instructions"** box.
4.  Select Gemini 2.5 or Gemini 3 as model.
5.  Paste the complete **"Kairós Onboarding Prompt"** and chat with the AI to generate your sections 0 and 6.
6.  Once you have your sections 0 and 6, inject them into the Kairós prompt, copy said prompt and paste it into a new chat repeating step 3 and 4.

## 7. Usage Guide and Best Practices

### Recommended Environment
After several empirical tests, it is concluded that **Google Gemini (models 2.5 or 3)** offers the best performance due to its large context window and ability to adhere to complex role instructions.

**Results of Tests with Other Models:**
*   **GPT-5 and Claude Opus 4.5:** Although powerful models, they showed difficulty following the prompt verbatim during long sessions ("instruction drift").
*   **Grok 3 and 4:** Rejected the prompt outright, activating security filters that interpret the system instruction as an attempt to "jailbreak" or unauthorized replacement of its base personality.

**If you decide to test with other future models, do not hesitate to share your results in the repository Issues.**

### The Golden Rule
**Do not blindly trust Kairós.**
Kairós is a tool for *questioning*, and that includes questioning the tool itself. Use it to generate friction in your thinking, not to externalize your responsibility to judge reality.
